/*
 * One plugin instance's whole bridge: the listener or macOS relay, the connection when
 * there is one, the audio it has collected and the snapshot the audio thread plays.
 *
 * Thread rules, which are the reason this class exists at all:
 *   - The worker thread owns the connection, the store and the layout. Nothing else touches
 *     them, so none of them needs a lock.
 *   - The audio thread calls Render() and NoteTransport(). Both are wait-free.
 *   - Everything the host tells us on the main thread (sample rate, track index) arrives as an
 *     atomic the worker picks up on its next round, rather than as a call into its state.
 *
 * A disconnect is deliberately not a reset: the audio OpenUtau already rendered stays, so the
 * DAW can go on playing and mixing a project whose editor has been closed. Only a new layout
 * replaces the old one, and it does so wholesale.
